This is a beginner friendly project using MySql for creating a Library Management SystemðŸ“š
A database named Library is created and 6 different tables are created in it. 
Each table serves a different purpose.
Table "branch" contains details about different branches of the library including branch id, address, manager id, and contact number of the library
Table "employee" contains details about the employees in the library including name, id, position, salary and branch id
Table "books" contains ISBN of the book, title, rental price,author, publisher, status(whether the book is available)
Table "customer" contains details of the library's customers such as customer id, name, registration date and address.
Table "issueStatus" contains details about the books issued like book name, customer, issue id, issue date, ISBN of the books.
Table "returnStatus" contains details about the books that are returned: book name, customer, issue id, issue date, ISBN of the books.
Ofcorse these tables are interconnected ðŸ”„
With the help of MSql keywords and commands the data required for the smooth functioning of the library can be fetched. ðŸ’»
